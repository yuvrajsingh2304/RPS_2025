**Literature Review on PEC Testing for Corrosion Monitoring in RC Structures**

The application of Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) and related eddy current (EC) techniques for corrosion detection in reinforced concrete (RC) structures has gained attention globally due to their non-contact nature, penetration capability, and adaptability to field conditions. The following review synthesizes key developments in the field.

**Auld and Moulder (1999)** provided a foundational review of quantitative eddy current nondestructive evaluation (NDE), summarizing advances in probe design, material characterization, and signal modeling. This work laid the theoretical groundwork for subsequent PEC innovations, especially for conductive materials like embedded steel.

**Huang and Wang (2016)** extended this knowledge through a detailed presentation of electromagnetic NDT technologies, including PEC, in concrete and steel structures. The book covered design aspects, electronics integration, and advanced diagnostic capabilities, serving as a reference for modular system development.

**Alcântara et al. (2015)** explored the application of EC testing to assess different stages of rebar corrosion. They found that signal resolution and depth of detection depend heavily on coil geometry and frequency selection, underscoring the importance of careful calibration when applying PEC in real-world concrete scenarios.

**Eddy et al. (2019)** conducted comprehensive PEC studies on rebars embedded in concrete. Their work demonstrated that PEC decay signal characteristics can estimate rebar cross-sectional loss due to corrosion, even at depths up to 110 mm. This study supports PEC's role in quantitative, non-contact corrosion evaluation.

**Mukherjee et al. (2020)** developed a low-cost, phase-sensitive EC detection system using anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors integrated with Arduino. Their system accurately identified corrosion stages based on phase shifts, suggesting the feasibility of affordable PEC-based diagnostics tailored for Indian infrastructure.

**Kim et al. (2020)** investigated how moisture, concrete resistivity, and temperature affect EC signal integrity. Their findings emphasized the necessity of environmental compensation and encouraged hybrid sensing approaches—such as combining PEC with half-cell or GPR—for accurate field diagnostics.

**Jung et al. (2021)** designed resonant EC sensors optimized for thick concrete cover applications. Their tuned coil circuits significantly improved sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio, enabling better corrosion detection in older structures with deep rebar embedment.

**Key Findings Across Literature**:

* PEC enables **quantitative corrosion monitoring** and not just detection.
* **Sensor design** (coil tuning, geometry) and **calibration** are crucial for accurate results.
* **Environmental factors** (humidity, temperature, resistivity) influence EC readings and must be compensated for.
* **Low-cost, open-source platforms** (e.g., Arduino-based setups) are increasingly viable.
* There is **limited indigenous development** in India, indicating a large research and market opportunity.

**Patent Note**:
Commercial PEC-based systems (e.g., by Eddyfi, Olympus) are patented, especially for metallic pipelines and tanks. However, **adaptations for embedded rebars in RC structures remain underdeveloped** in the public domain, with **open-source, lab-buildable platforms still emerging**—offering potential for patentable innovations in sensor design, software algorithms, or integrated toolkits.
