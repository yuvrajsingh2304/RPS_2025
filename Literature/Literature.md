### **Literature Review on PEC Testing for Corrosion Monitoring in RC Structures**

The reviewed literature covers significant advancements in the development and application of Eddy Current Testing (ECT) and Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) techniques for detecting and quantifying corrosion in steel rebars embedded in concrete—crucial for ensuring the longevity and safety of reinforced concrete (RC) infrastructure.

**Auld and Moulder (1999)** provided a foundational theoretical framework for quantitative ECT, introducing forward and inverse problem modeling and exploring how defects like corrosion alter probe impedance. Their discussion of skin effect, reciprocity, and probe field interactions remains critical for advanced PEC and ECT modeling.

**Huang and Wang (2016)** emphasized the distinct advantages of PEC over single-frequency ECT, highlighting the use of pulse excitation with rich frequency content to analyze defects at multiple depths. Their chapter outlined probe design principles, noise suppression strategies, and the use of ferrite cores to enhance sensitivity and minimize lift-off noise.

**Alcantara et al. (2015)** investigated the eddy current response for different rebar corrosion stages and emphasized the influence of coil geometry and frequency on detection depth and signal quality. Their work provides experimental benchmarks for designing modular PEC systems.

**Eddy et al. (2019)** demonstrated that PEC decay signal characteristics could be used to estimate rebar cross-sectional loss due to corrosion, even through deep concrete covers (up to 110 mm). The study introduced the concept of using long-time signal decay independent of lift-off to assess corrosion depth.

**Mukherjee et al. (2020)** proposed a low-cost, portable platform using phase-sensitive detection and Anisotropic Magnetoresistive (AMR) sensors for early-stage corrosion detection. Their approach is particularly suited to incipient corrosion monitoring and surface-level degradation diagnostics.

**Ha et al. (2021)** designed a wireless PEC corrosion detection system for steel structures, integrating Arduino, Zigbee, and Raspberry Pi. Their innovation in using an RLC delay circuit enabled low-power wireless monitoring and proved the viability of integrating PEC into wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for SHM.

**Thibbotuwa et al. (2024)** introduced resonant EC sensors for corrosion detection through thick concrete covers (up to 5–6 cm). By tracking the parallel resistance (Rp) variation, they effectively quantified corrosion-induced material loss and addressed environmental compensation using temperature sensitivity analysis.

**He, D. (2024)** developed a portable eddy current system for corrosion assessment of rebars using a lock-in amplifier to analyze in-phase and quadrature signals. By examining the X-Y plot slope of the induced signal, different corrosion products were distinguished based on their conductivity and magnetic permeability. The study optimized excitation frequency (~80 kHz), coil types (toroidal vs. differential), and introduced a Helmholtz configuration to reduce noise and improve detection depth. It confirmed that eddy current phase response could accurately reflect corrosion progression.

**Key Findings Across Literature**:

* PEC enables **quantitative corrosion monitoring** and not just detection.
* **Sensor design** (coil tuning, geometry) and **calibration** are crucial for accurate results.
* **Environmental factors** (humidity, temperature, resistivity) influence EC readings and must be compensated for.
* **Low-cost, open-source platforms** (e.g., Arduino-based setups) are increasingly viable.
* There is **limited indigenous development** in India, indicating a large research and market opportunity.

### **Patent Note**:
Commercial PEC-based systems (e.g., by Eddyfi, Olympus) are patented, especially for metallic pipelines and tanks. However, **adaptations for embedded rebars in RC structures remain underdeveloped** in the public domain, with **open-source, lab-buildable platforms still emerging**—offering potential for patentable innovations in sensor design, software algorithms, or integrated toolkits.
